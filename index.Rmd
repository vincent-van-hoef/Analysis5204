# Introduction

The ANCA-associated vasculitides are rare but severe autoimmune disorders.
Tools for improved diagnostics and prognostics are needed. In this project, 184
proteins (Olink; CARDIOVASCULAR III and INFLAMMATION panels) and four
additional proteins (Luminex data) were measured in serum or plasma samples
from patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and several controls (healthy,
remission, disease control), in order to identify biomarkers for active
disease, organ involvement and accurate diagnosis.

To accomplish this, following analyses have been agreed upon:

* Quality Control of PEA data
* Unsupervised analysis of data structure using PCA
* Differential expression of samples comparing selected subgroups:
  - Active AAV vs Healthy (for GPA, MPA, MPO and PR3)
  - Active AAV vs Remission AAV (for GPA, MPA, MPO and PR3)
  - Active AAV vs RA or SLE Nephritis (for GPA, MPA, MPO and PR3)
  - Active disease (GPA vs MPA and MPO vs PR3)
  - Remission (GPA vs MPA and MPO vs PR3)
* Serum and plasma Samples will be analyzed separately
* Pathway analysis of differential expressed proteins using KEGG, GO, MsigDB, ... gene set collections
* Correlation of proteins with the inflammation markers and BVAS scores
* Effect of cortisone treatment on protein expression
* Biomarkers/Predictors of GPA vs MPA and MPO-ANCA+ vs PR3-ANCA+ (using appropriate multivariate techniques)
