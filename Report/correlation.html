<p>To assess how each protein’s expression follows with two inflammation markers and the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, correlation coefficients were calculated. In particular, Pearson correlations of each protein versus crp, sr and bvas values were calculated.</p>

<div id="crp" class="section level3" number="5.1.1">

<p>The full list of protein-wise Pearson correlation results for the different phenotypes with crp is collected in excel files in <strong>Results/Plasma/Correlation/crp/crp_phenotype_pearson_correlation.xlsx</strong> and shown in the table below.</p>
<p>All individuals regressions are plotted and collected in the subfolder <strong>regression_plots/</strong> (see Figure <a href="correlation.html#fig:crpCorr">5.1</a>). MPA and GPA or MPO and PR3 are each plotted on the same plot, but visualized in a different color.</p>

<p>All individuals regressions are plotted and collected in the subfolder <strong>regression_plots/</strong> (see Figure <a href="correlation.html#fig:srCorr">5.2</a>). MPA and GPA or MPO and PR3 are each plotted on the same plot, but visualized in a different color.</p>
