<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The ANCA-associated vasculitides are rare but severe autoimmune disorders.
Tools for improved diagnostics and prognostics are needed. In this project, 184
proteins (Olink; CARDIOVASCULAR III and INFLAMMATION panels) and four
additional proteins (Luminex data) were measured in serum or plasma samples
from patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and several controls (healthy,
remission, disease control), in order to identify biomarkers for active
disease, organ involvement and accurate diagnosis.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, following analyses have been agreed upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality Control of PEA data</li>
<li>Unsupervised analysis of data structure using PCA</li>
<li>Differential expression of first set of samples comparing selected subgroups:
<ul>
<li>Active AAV vs Healthy</li>
<li>Active AAV vs Remission AAV</li>
<li>Active AAV vs Disease Control</li>
<li>GPA vs MPA</li>
<li>MPO-ANCA+ vs PR3-ANCA+</li>
<li>(Comparison between affected organs)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Serum and plasma Samples will be analyzed separately</li>
<li>Pathway analysis of differential expressed proteins using KEGG, GO, MsigDB, … gene set collections</li>
<li>Correlation of proteins with the inflammation markers and BVAS scores</li>
<li>Effect of cortisone treatment on protein expression</li>
<li>Biomarkers/Predictors of GPA vs MPA and MPO-ANCA+ vs PR3-ANCA+ (using appropriate multivariate techniques)</li>
</ul>

<p>This report describes the performed analyses and a selection of the resulting
output for one comparison of the plasma results only. The full results and all plots are found in the accompanying Results folder.</p>
