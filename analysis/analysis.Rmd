  Model uncertainty and limited data are fundamental challenges to
  robust management of human intervention in a natural system.
  These challenges are acutely highlighted by concerns that
  many ecological systems may contain tipping points, such as
  Allee population sizes.  Before a collapse, we do not know
  where the tipping points lie, if they exist at all.  Hence,
  we know neither a complete model of the system dynamics nor
  do we have access to data in some large region of state-space
  where such a tipping point might exist.  We illustrate how
  a Bayesian Non-Parametric (BNP) approach using a Gaussian
  Process (GP) prior provides a flexible representation of this
  inherent uncertainty. We embed GPs in a Stochastic Dynamic
  Programming (SDP) framework in order to make robust management
  predictions with both model uncertainty and limited data. We
  use simulations to evaluate this approach as compared with the
  standard approach of using model selection to choose from a set
  of candidate models.  We find that model selection erroneously
  favors models without tipping points -- leading to harvest
  policies that guarantee extinction. The GPDP performs nearly as
  well as the true model and significantly outperforms standard
  approaches. We illustrate this using examples of simulated
  single-species dynamics, where the standard model selection
  approach should be most effective, and find that it still
  fails to account for uncertainty appropriately and leads to
  population crashes, while management based on the GPDP does
  not, since it does not underestimate the uncertainty outside
  of the observed data.
