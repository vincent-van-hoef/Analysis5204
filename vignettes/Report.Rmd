# Introduction

The ANCA-associated vasculitides are rare but severe autoimmune disorders. Tools for improved diagnostics and prognostics are needed. In this project, 184 proteins (Olink; CARDIOVASCULAR III and INFLAMMATION panels) were measured in serum or plasma samples from patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and several controls (healthy, remission, disease control), in order to identify biomarkers for active disease, organ involvement and accurate diagnosis.

To accomplish this, following analyses have been agreed upon:

* Quality Control of PEA data
* Unsupervised analysis of data structure using PCA
* Differential expression of first set of samples comparing selected subgroups:
  - Active AAV vs Healthy
  - Active AAV vs Remission AAV
  - Active AAV vs Disease Control
  - GPA vs MPA 
  - MPO-ANCA+ vs PR3-ANCA+
  - (Comparison between affected organs)
* Serum and plasma Samples will be analyzed separately
* Pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins using KEGG, GO, MsigDB, ... gene set collections
* Biomarkers/Predictors of GPA vs MPA and MPO-ANCA+ vs PR3-ANCA+ (using appropriate ML techniques)

**This report describes the performed analyses and the resulting output. The full results and plots are found in the accompanying folder ``r params$save``.**
