# Introduction

The ANCA-associated vasculitides are rare but severe autoimmune disorders. Tools for improved diagnostics and prognostics are needed. In this project, 184 proteins (Olink; CARDIOVASCULAR III and INFLAMMATION panels) and four additional proteins (Luminex data) were measured in serum or plasma samples from patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and several controls (healthy, remission, disease control), in order to identify biomarkers for active disease, organ involvement and accurate diagnosis.

To accomplish this, following analyses have been agreed upon:

* Quality Control of PEA data
* Unsupervised analysis of data structure using PCA
* Differential expression of first set of samples comparing selected subgroups:
  - Active AAV vs Healthy
  - Active AAV vs Remission AAV
  - Active AAV vs Disease Control
  - GPA vs MPA 
  - MPO-ANCA+ vs PR3-ANCA+
  - (Comparison between affected organs)
* Serum and plasma Samples will be analyzed separately
* Pathway analysis of differential expressed proteins using KEGG, GO, MsigDB, ... gene set collections
* Correlation of proteins with the inflammation markers and BVAS scores
* Effect of cortisone treatment on protein expression
* Biomarkers/Predictors of GPA vs MPA and MPO-ANCA+ vs PR3-ANCA+ (using appropriate ML techniques)

**This report describes the performed analyses and a selection of the resulting output of the plasma results only. The full results and all plots are found in the accompanying Results folder.**

# Data Cleaning

## Clinical Data

The metadata for the separate subgroups was combined into a single metadata dataframe per tissue. Column names were cleaned and made consistent between the different subgroups to allow for easier handling in R. Further cleaning of the dates was performed in R using the *lubridate* package and annotations such as age, time in freezer, BVAS score and site of sample origin were added as well. Samples without Olink data were removed from the metadata of plasma ("lun1065") and/or serum (("lin113", "sle_121/a" and "sle_156/a").

The resulting metadata for serum and plasma separately is saved in the folder **Results/Plasma/plasma_metadata.csv** and **Results/Serum/serum_metadata.csv** respectively.

## Expression Data

Names of the samples were cleaned and modified to correspond to the metadata. Three samples that were present in the expression data but had no metadata were removed ("lun1059", "iga2156" and "umu78").

Three proteins (MCP-1, OPG and uPA) are measured in both the Cardiovascular and the Inflammation panel. The expression values correlate well between the panels so only the Inflammation data is kept for these proteins.

All data and metadata can also be accessed via R:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vincent-van-hoef/Analysis5204")
library("Analysis5204")
data(list=c("plasma_metadata", "plasma_npx", "serum_metadata", "serum_npx", "gsea_sets", "lum_dat"), 
      package = "Analysis5204")
```

# Quality Control

One sample sample (VASKA637) is filtered out due to technical concerns (failed sample according to Olink QC rapport).

**Shown here are the results for the plasma samples. The QC of the serum samples is available in the folder /Serum/QC/**

### Data Distribution

A general overview of the data distribution per plasma sample per panel, and ordered by the median value on that panel is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plDistrBox). They show one boxplot per sample and can be colored by any feature, but by default are colored by whether the sample passed technical QC (“QC_Warning” status as defined by Olink). The things to look for in this plot are odd distributions, deviant medians and patterns among the outlier assays. Overall, distributions are fairly similar and the medians are comparable. Two samples in the INFLAMMATION panel are deemed to have failed the technical QC, but a further investigation has to show whether to remove them from the dataset.

```{r plDistrBox, out.width="49%",out.height="49%",fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Boxplots of NPX distribution per sample by panel ordered by median NPX value", fig.subcap=c("Cardiovascular III", "Inflammation")}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../Results/Plasma/QC/plasma_CVIII_dist.png",
"../Results/Plasma/QC/plasma_INF_dist.png"))
```

The distribution plot can get difficult to read when there are a large number of samples or many panels. Plotting the interquartile range (IQR) vs the median shows an alternative view on the data distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:plIQR)). Most samples cluster together, some samples have a slightly more extreme IQR. Even though two samples are marked with QC warnings, their data distributions (and PCA plot - data not shown) look ok. According to the Olink data analysis tutorial, this means the samples can be kept for downstream analysis so they were retained for further analysis.

```{r plIQR, fig.show='hold', out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Interquartile range versus median per sample by panel ordered by median NPX value. Dashed lines indicate 3 standard deviations from the median or IQR mean."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../Results/Plasma/QC/plasma_qc.png"))
```
## PCA

Using [Principal Component Analysis](http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis) (PCA), we examine the structure of the data by projecting the samples on a two-dimensional graph using the two first principal components. These components are linear combinations of the proteins that explain the most variation between those samples. These plots can be used to examine the samples for outliers, sample swaps, batch effects and other relationships. When normalization successfully removed technical or batch artefacts, the relative distances should be biologically interpretable. A plot of PC1 vs PC2 using the 100 most variable proteins and colored by their biological/experimental group is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plPCA). Each point corresponds to a sample plotted by PC1 and PC2. The different experimental groups do seem to differ, especially along PC1. Also, the healthy control samples seem to cluster more together than the active or other control samples.

```{r plPCA, fig.show='hold', out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="PCA plot of all plasma samples coloured by biological group."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../Results/Plasma/QC/plasma_pca_100.png"))
```

In the QC folder you will find additionally a PCA plot of PC1 vs PC3, a screeplot showing the explained variation per PC and a barplot showing the top and bottom genes contributing to the variation on PC1.
